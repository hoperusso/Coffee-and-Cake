# Coffee-and-Cake
My very first project! Creating a simple website with simple formatting, images, and relative links.
I am taking a course on Udemy called The Result-Oriented Web Developer Course - BOOTCAMP 2020, and this is the first of nine projects included in the course. 
I am tremendously excited to develop a skillset I haven't used since early '00s vanity sites, and I welcome any insight and constructive criticism as I learn more about web development.
